# QuantumLayer Logo Usage Guidelines

## Logo Components

All QuantumLayer brand logos share three key components:

1. **Layer Stack**: Two or three blue gradient rectangular layers with rounded corners, stacked with a slight offset
2. **Orbital Element**: An orange circular particle with an orbital path around the layers
3. **Wordmark**: The name in a clean sans-serif font, with "Quantum" in white/black and the sub-brand suffix in its brand color

## Logo Variations

Each brand in the QuantumLayer ecosystem has the following logo variations:

- **Standard (Dark Background)**: Full logo with wordmark on dark background
- **Standard (Light Background)**: Full logo with wordmark on light background
- **Icon Only**: Just the layer stack and orbital element without text
- **Wordmark Only**: Text-only version for space-constrained applications

## Sizing Guidelines

- **Minimum Size (Digital)**: The icon should never appear smaller than 24x24 pixels
- **Minimum Size (Print)**: The icon should never appear smaller than 0.25 inches (6.35mm)
- **Wordmark Minimum**: The full wordmark should never appear smaller than 80 pixels wide or 0.75 inches (19.05mm)

## Clear Space

Maintain a clear space around all logo variations equal to the height of the "q" in the wordmark. No other elements should intrude on this space.

## Improper Logo Usage

Do not:
- Alter the colors outside the official palette
- Stretch or distort the logo
- Rearrange the components
- Add effects like shadows, outlines, or glows
- Place on low-contrast backgrounds
- Rotate the logo
- Use outdated versions

## Logo Placement

- **UI Applications**: Place in upper left corner of applications
- **Documentation**: Center at top of cover pages, upper left for interior pages
- **Marketing Materials**: Flexible placement with adequate clear space

## Sub-brand Co-branding

When showing multiple QuantumLayer brand logos together:

1. Lead with the parent QuantumLayer logo
2. Arrange sub-brand logos in a consistent order
3. Maintain equal sizing across all logos
4. Use adequate spacing between logos (minimum 2x clear space rule)

## File Formats

- **SVG**: Preferred for digital applications
- **PNG**: For digital applications requiring raster format
- **PDF**: For high-quality print applications
