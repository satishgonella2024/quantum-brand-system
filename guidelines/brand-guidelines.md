# QuantumLayer Brand Guidelines

## Brand Story

QuantumLayer is a powerful ecosystem for AI agent development, deployment, and management. The brand represents the cutting-edge intersection of quantum-inspired computing and artificial intelligence, providing a sophisticated yet accessible platform for the next generation of AI systems.

## Logo Architecture

The QuantumLayer logo system is built on three key components:

1. **Stacked Layers**: Representing the multi-layered approach to AI infrastructure
2. **Orbital Particle**: Symbolizing the dynamic, quantum-inspired nature of the system
3. **Typography**: Clean, modern type treatment with dual-color approach

## Color System

### Parent Brand Colors

- **Primary Blue Gradient**: 
  - Top Layer: #4CD4FF → #2E8BFF
  - Bottom Layer: #3A52FF → #7747FF
- **Particle Orange**: #FF9040
- **Background Dark**: #0A0E1A
- **Text White**: #FFFFFF

### Sub-brand Color System

Each sub-brand maintains consistency with the parent brand while establishing its own identity through a unique primary color:

| Sub-brand | Primary Color | Accent Color | Application |
|-----------|---------------|--------------|-------------|
| QuantumHub | #8A63D2 (Purple) | #F0EFFF (Light Purple) | Registry interface |
| QuantumDesk | #00BFA6 (Teal) | #E6FCF5 (Light Teal) | Desktop application |
| QuantumCLI | #F29E4C (Orange) | #FFF5E5 (Light Orange) | Command line interface |
| QuantumD | #4C6EF5 (Blue) | #EAF2FF (Light Blue) | Backend services |
| QuantumSDK | #D6336C (Pink) | #FFF0F6 (Light Pink) | Development kit |

## Typography

- **Primary Font**: Inter (Sans-serif)
- **Headings**: Inter Bold
- **Body**: Inter Regular
- **Code Elements**: Fira Code (Monospace)

## Sub-brand Integration

When creating sub-brand assets:

1. Maintain the core stacked layer and orbital particle motif
2. Apply the sub-brand's primary color to the suffix portion of the wordmark
3. Use the sub-brand's accent color for backgrounds in light mode applications
4. Ensure proper spacing and proportions consistent with the parent brand

## Logo Spacing

The QuantumLayer logo and all sub-brand logos require proper spacing to maintain visual integrity. The minimum clear space around the logo should be equal to the height of the 'q' in the wordmark.

## Improper Usage

Do not:
- Alter the colors outside the specified palette
- Change the proportions of the logo elements
- Rotate or distort the logo
- Add effects like shadows or glows
- Place the logo on visually busy backgrounds
- Use the sub-brand suffix color for the "Quantum" portion of any wordmark
